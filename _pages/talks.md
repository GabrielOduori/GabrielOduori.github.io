<!-- The growing availability of open geospatial data presents significant opportunities to address spatial and temporal gaps in air quality (AQ) monitoring. This is particularly crucial in resource-limited and underserved regions. In this study, we introduce a novel framework that combines low-cost sensor (LCS) measurements with Land Use Regression (LUR) models, utilising publicly accessible datasets to improve the spatial and temporal resolution of AQ estimates. By integrating empirical sensor data with open, openly available model predictors, the framework enhances the accuracy of air quality predictions, particularly in areas with limited high-density monitoring infrastructure.

The open LUR model uses freely available data, such as traffic density, land cover, population distribution, and meteorological information, from OpenStreet Map and OpenWeatherMap, to predict local pollutant concentrations. These predictions are dynamically calibrated with real-time LCS measurements through machine learning regression techniques, which adjust for sensor biases, reduce noise, and quantify uncertainties. This integration allows for a more accurate, real-time representation of air pollution levels, especially in urban areas where traditional monitoring is often inadequate or nonexistent.

To demonstrate our framework's capability in refining Nitrogen Dioxide (NO₂) and Particulate Matter (PM₂.₅) estimates, we conduct a study in a dense population area in Nairobi, Kenya. Our result achieves a significant improvement in alignment with regulatory-grade measurements. By relying on open data and open-source LUR models, this approach is scalable, adaptable, and transferable, making it a cost-effective solution for AQ monitoring in diverse geographic and socio-economic settings.

This work emphasises the transformative potential of open data and open LUR models in democratising access to high-resolution, real-time air quality monitoring tools. By combining low-cost sensors with these open-source data and models, the framework offers actionable insights for urban planning, public health initiatives, and environmental policy. It underscores the broad applicability of this solution in addressing global air pollution challenges, providing scalable tools for effective air quality management and policy-making across various regions. -->

**Air Pollution Monitoring: A Probabilistic Model for Fusing Satellite Imagery and Low-Cost Sensor Observations**

*International Conference on Advanced Remote Sensing (ICARS 2025)*
University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain
March 27, 2025

<!-- Accurate and timely air quality monitoring relies on data integration methods that bridge the spatial coverage of satellite imagery and the temporal granularity of low-cost sensors (LCSs). LCSs provide high-frequency measurements but are prone to noise, while satellite data offer extensive coverage but suffer from coarse temporal resolution and retrieval uncertainties. To address these limitations, we present a novel probabilistic data fusion framework rooted in generic Bayesian filtering. Our approach employs Kalman Filters (KFs) for dynamic state estimation and uncertainty quantification. We enrich the KF state estimation with covariates generated by Land Use Regression (LUR) to incorporate local spatial context.

We fuse nitrogen dioxide (NO2) data from low-cost sensor networks with satellite-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD) measurements from Sentinel-5P, using ground reference data for calibration and validation. Evaluated in the Dublin City area, the preliminary results demonstrate a significant reduction in bias and improved accuracy and precision of air quality estimates.

This framework addresses critical challenges in multi-source data integration, including a lack of a consistent model, resolution mismatches, noise propagation, and bias correction. By bridging global and local scales, it provides actionable insights for air quality management and environmental policy. -->
