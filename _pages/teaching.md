## University College Dublin

### MSc Course

**Programming for GIS** (Spring 2026)

*Dublin, Ireland*

Currently tutoring as part of the teaching team for this module. This part of the course teaches PyQGIS programming, enabling students to extend and automate QGIS functionality using Python. We explore the PyQGIS API, allowing students to interact with QGIS layers, create custom tools, and automate geospatial workflows.

**Python for GIS** (Autumn 2025)

*Dublin, Ireland*

Tutored as part of the teaching team for the module Python for GIS.

We guided students to develop advanced technical and conceptual skills, integrating Python into geospatial science and mastering open-source tools like GeoPandas, GDAL, rasterio, Fiona, and PySAL.

Through hands-on projects, students learned to:
- Automate geospatial workflows
- Apply geospatial machine learning techniques
- Solve real-world spatial problems

This prepares them for high-demand roles in geospatial analytics and data science.
