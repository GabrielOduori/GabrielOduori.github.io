My research focuses on how probabilistic techniques can advance and scale-up understanding dynamics of urban air quality. I am interested in computational statistics, Gaussian processes and Bayesian inference and their applicationb in space and time data. 

I am supervised by [Assistant Prof. Dr. Chiara Cocco](https://people.ucd.ie/chiara.cocco) and [Prof. Francesco Pilla](https://people.ucd.ie/francesco.pilla) at Spatial Dynamics Lab where we explore sensing technologies for smart Urban environments.

Alongside my academic work, I also tutor MSc classes mostly programming in geospatial science.
