**RESTORATION** is a Science Foundation Ireland-funded initiative addressing urban flood risks through nature-based solutions in Dublin.

## About

The project combines remote sensing technology, artificial intelligence, and community engagement to help urban landscapes better absorb and retain surface water, with a particular emphasis on domestic gardens as flood mitigation tools.

Dublin's urbanisation has created extensive impervious surfaces - approximately 63.8% of the city - reducing water infiltration and increasing flooding risks. RESTORATION develops a decision-support framework that uses satellite imagery, AI, and hydrological modelling to help property owners identify suitable nature-based garden modifications.

## Key Features

- Remote sensing and satellite imagery analysis
- AI-driven decision-support framework
- Hydrological modelling for urban flood mitigation
- Community engagement for nature-based solutions
- Cost-effective and environmentally sustainable approaches

## Partners

- University College Dublin
- Dublin City Council
- Local Authority Waters Programme
- Office of Public Works
